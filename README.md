## Purpose 
Quick experimentation with react and Giphy API 
While typing in the search a query is send to giphy API to list 10 results in the right column.
Selecting a result will highlight the image in the left column. 
A quick demo can be seen here : https://jeremy-jouffroy.github.io/react-giphy/
Beware that due to the fact that the API key in the package is a test one, the app can seem pretty slow while in reality you just manage to saturate the API key query limits :D

## Scripts

To install all necessary module 
```bash
yarn install 
```
this will load the necessary package such as webpack react babel and giphy-api


To start the local Webpack Dev Server (usually on port `8080`):

```bash
yarn start
```
